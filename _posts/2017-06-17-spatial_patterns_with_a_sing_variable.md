In this post, we're about to discuss dominant spatial patterns formally.

## What's spatial patterns?

In climate researches, it is common to apply dominant spatial patterns to interpret physical phenomenon and spatial variation of a climate variable, e.g., sea surface temperature. 

For example, there are two major spatial patters (mode) of sea surface temperature in the Indian Ocean. That is, a basin model (top panel) and a dipole model (bottom panel) in the following graph.

A basin-wide mode indicates that there is a sub-region with a u-shaped hole in the pattern, and means the spatial variation in this sub-region is clearly decreasing downside (or increasing upside). An east-west dipole mode illustrates that the variation of sea surface temperature in the eastern region is opposite to the one in the wester region. In other words, while the sea surface temperature in the eastern Indian Ocean becomes higher, the temperature in the western Indian Ocean more likely becomes lower. It is worth to notice that the interaction between these two patterns and El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a popular topic in the climate field.
