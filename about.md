  The business of the statistician is to catalyze the scientific learning process. -- George Box

Iâ€™m a data scientist and researcher with a background in statistics in Taiwan. This blog is to share R/Python related things, and statistical/ML methodologies.

In the field of Statisitcs, my interests are broad. Mainly, however, I am interested in high-dimensional data analysis, and spatial data analysis. I also maintain two open-source applications: [SpatPCA](https://github.com/egpivo/SpatPCA) and [SpatMCA](https://github.com/egpivo/SpatMCA).
